# Modular GPS Tracker

This is a project made by me in 2018 when I was 16.

This project entered into the Eskom Expo Sciencefair.

Excuse the messy file structures and odd files. I had no idea of git at the time of making the project and this was a big learning experience for me.

The project is fully documented in ``Report File.docx`` Word document. An pdf converted version (which may be outdated) can be found as ``Report File*.pdf``

I might return to this project in the future but using a diffirent repo. If so, I will archive this project.
